# Welcome to My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post on Podium! This application is built with Go and the Gin web framework.

## What is Podium?

Podium is a lightweight, markdown-powered website and blog platform. It's designed to be simple yet powerful, allowing you to:

- Write blog posts in Markdown
- Create static pages easily
- Automatically generate navigation from your content

## Features

### Markdown Support

All posts and pages support full Markdown syntax, including:

- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- Lists (like this one!)
- Code blocks
- Headings
- And much more!

### Example Code Block

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Podium!")
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post, simply add a new `.md` file to the `posts` folder. The application will automatically detect it and add it to your posts list.

For static pages, add `.md` files to the `static` folder, and they'll appear in your navigation menu automatically!

### Quote Example

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy using Podium as much as I enjoyed building it. Happy blogging!
